🚀 CertiFlow
Automated Attendance & E-Certificate Generation System
CertiFlow is a web-based automation platform designed to manage event attendance verification and automatic e-certificate generation. It eliminates manual work and ensures certificates are issued only to verified participants using email and GPS-based verification.
📌 Project Overview
Managing attendance and certificate distribution in events such as symposiums, hackathons, and workshops is time-consuming and error-prone. CertiFlow solves this problem by automating the entire workflow—from participant registration to secure certificate delivery.
